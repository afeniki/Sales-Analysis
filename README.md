**Sales Dataset Analysis Project**

This repository hosts an analysis project focused on a sales dataset comprising over 185 columns. 
The dataset was subjected to rigorous data cleaning procedures using Power Query, where duplicate and blank values were identified and rectified.
Furthermore, data formats were meticulously adjusted to enhance consistency and facilitate analysis.

**Dataset Columns**:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each sales order.
Product: Name of the product sold.
Quantity Ordered: Number of units of the product ordered.
Price Each: Unit price of the product.
Order Date: Date of the sales order.
Purchase Address: Address details including street, city, and postal code.
Month: Month of the sales order.
Sales: Total sales amount for each order.
City: City where the purchase was made.
Hour: Hour of the day when the purchase occurred.
The dataset underwent meticulous formatting adjustments, including the correction of date and time formats to retain only the date component for analysis purposes. Moreover, the address column was disaggregated into individual components such as street, city, and postal code to enhance granularity.

All floating-point number columns were converted to decimal number types and rounded to two decimal places to ensure consistency and precision in the analysis.
